class SearchAlgorithm:
    """Iterative Search Algorithm (ISA).

    To solve an an optimization problem's instance (PI), one needs to
    define a procedure (an algorithm). This library focuses on
    Iterative Search Algorithms (ISAs) - algorithms that,
    iteration after iteration, take decisions (probabilistic or not)
    to improve upon the current solution.

    An instance of an ISA is characterized by the following features:
        1) a PI (i.e., what to solve/optimize);
        2) a function to initialize the solve at a given point of the
         solve space (ùëÜ);
        3) the best solution found by the ISA.

    To solve a PI, an ISA:
        1) initializes the solve at a given point in ùëÜ (normally, by
         sampling candidate solution(s) at random);
        2) searches throughout ùëÜ, in iterative manner, for the best
         possible solution, according to the criteria specified in PI.
         Traditionally, the termination condition for an ISA is the
         number of iterations, the default stopping criteria in this
         library.
    These two steps are implemented as abstract methods "_initialize"
    and "solve", meaning that every subclass of type SearchAlgorithm
    has to implement them.
